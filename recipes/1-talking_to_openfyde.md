# Talking to the openFyde (via ssh, not megaphone)


## Objectives

You have produced a bootable openFyde image, it boots! ðŸŽŠ

Now you wish to connect to your openFyde instance and see what's going on inside the mysterious black box. To achieve this, we need to:
 - mount the root file system of the openFyde device
 - set a password for the default shell user, `chronos`
 - enable password authentication


## Preparation

Boot your openFyde image on the target device and make sure you have physical kvm(keyboard, monitor and mouse) access to it.


## Procedures

1. Boot openFyde on the target device, connect to the network, invoke the (bash) shell command-line interface

2. Enter the following commands:

```
(device)$ sudo su

(device)$ mount -o remount,rw /

# change password
(device)$ passwd

# enable PasswordAuthentication
(device)$ sed -i "s/PasswordAuthentication.*/PasswordAuthentication yes/g" /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# restart sshd
(device)$ initctl restart openssh-server
```

3. You should now be able to ssh connect to your openFyde device from another machine that has ssh client via password authentication


## How it works

The primary gotcha is that if you don't mount the root file system, `passwd` command would fail. Always remember to mount the root file system to `rw` if you wish to mess with the root file system.
